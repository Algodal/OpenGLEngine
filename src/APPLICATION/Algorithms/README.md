# Algorithms

The main goal of this project is to learn OpenGL.  It's not a game engine :laughing:!.
An offshoot of learning is that we may discover patterns or a common sequence of code
that we realize will be made more useful by wrapping it in a library or a function for
re-use in future projects for ease-of use.  We build these algorithms (roll credits, :laughing:) here.
